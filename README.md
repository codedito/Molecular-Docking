# Molecular Docking of *Persea americana* Seed Compounds as PPAR-γ Agonists

## Overview

This repository contains the molecular docking workflow and supporting materials for my undergraduate final year project titled:

**“Molecular Docking of *Persea americana* Seed Extract Compounds as PPAR Gamma Protein Agonists in Type 2 Diabetes Treatment.”**

The study explores bioactive compounds from avocado (*Persea americana*) seeds as potential agonists of the **PPAR-γ protein**, a key therapeutic target in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM.

## Project Objectives

* Identify phytochemical compounds present in *Persea americana* seed extracts
* Evaluate antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of the extracts
* Perform **in-silico molecular docking** of selected compounds against the PPAR-γ protein
* Assess binding affinity, interaction residues, and drug-likeness of selected ligands

---

## Methods Summary

### Experimental

* **Extraction:** Aqueous, ethanol, and methanol seed extracts
* **Phytochemical Screening:** Qualitative and quantitative analysis
* **Antioxidant Assays:**

  * DPPH radical scavenging
  * Nitric oxide scavenging
  * Reducing power assay
* **Cytotoxicity Assay:** MTT assay using Vero cell lines

### Computational (In-silico)

* **Ligand Source:** PubChem
* **Ligand Optimization:** Avogadro
* **Protein Target:** PPAR-γ (retrieved from RCSB PDB)
* **Docking Software:** AutoDock Tools 1.5.6
* **Interaction Analysis:** PLIP (Protein–Ligand Interaction Profiler)
* **Drug-likeness Screening:** SwissADME (Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, Egan, Muegge rules)

## Key Results

* GC-MS identified **83, 50, and 40 compounds** in aqueous, ethanol, and methanol extracts respectively
* Several indole-based compounds showed **strong binding affinity** to PPAR-γ
* Best docking scores reached up to **−11.15 kcal/mol**
* Selected compounds shared active residues with known PPAR-γ agonists
* Ethanol extract showed **low cytotoxicity** on Vero cells (EC₅₀ ≈ 1479 µg/mL)
